# AJAX Services

Head over to `sidebar.vue` where we make the categories AJAX call. In
Symfony, we often isolate complex logic - or logic that we need to reuse - into
services. One of the *most* common places that we do that is for database queries:
we almost *always* have a *repository* class that holds all the database queries
for a specific table.

It's optional, but I'd like to do the same with my frontend code! I'd like
to isolate all of my AJAX requests for a specific *resource* - like categories
or products - into its own, reusable JavaScript module. Then, instead of having
AJAX calls inside my components, all that logic will be centralized.

## Adding a Service!

In Symfony, "Services" is *kind of* a generic word for any class that does work.
But in this context, I'm using "services" to mean something slightly
different. These "services" are *API* services... or, really, any code that
loads data - whether that's via an AJAX call, local storage or reading
global variables that we set in Twig.

Inside of `js/services/`, create a new file called `categories-service.js`.
The `-service` on the end is *totally* redundant since we're in a `services/`
directory, but I like to have descriptive filenames.

The `services/` directory already holds one other file called `page-context`. This
has *nothing* to do with AJAX calls or APIs but it *is* something that returns data,
which is why I put it here. Right now it reads a global variable, but if we
decided later to load this via AJAX, it would *still* be a service.

In `categories-service.js` export a function called, how about, `fetchCategories()`.
For the logic, copy the `axios` line from `sidebar`... and paste it here. PhpStorm
helpfully imported `axios` *for* me... but I'll tweak the quotes. Back in the
function, return `axios.get()`.

[[[ code('99cdef390d') ]]]

This is a really, *really* simple AJAX call, but at *least* we're centralizing the
URL so that we don't have it all over the place. Let's also be good programmers and
add some documentation above this: it returns a `Promise`... which, actually,
PhpStorm already knew without us saying anything.

But I won't add a description because the function name already describes this
pretty well.

[[[ code('6dee877aca') ]]]

## Use it from `sidebar.vue`

Ok: in `sidebar.vue`, let's use this! First, import the service:
`import {} from '@/services/categories-service'`. Inside the curly braces,
grab `fetchCategories`.

[[[ code('a4d90032c2') ]]]

Now down in `created`, life gets *much* simpler: `const response =` - keep the `await`
because we *still* want to wait for the function to finish - then `fetchCategories()`.

[[[ code('9d2316006e') ]]]

I *love* this! And to clean up, since we're not using `axios` directly in this
component, we can remove the import.

## Create the Products Service

The *other* place where we're making an AJAX call is in `catalog.vue` to fetch
the products. This one is a *bit* more complex because *if* we have a
category, we need to pass a `category` query parameter.

Since this AJAX call is for a different API resource, inside the `services/`
directory, create a third file called `products-service.js`.

Start the same way: `export function fetchProducts()` with a `categoryIri` argument.
I've been calling this `categoryId` so far, but in reality, this *is* the IRI, so
I'll give it the proper name here.

[[[ code('da9048697d') ]]]

For the logic, go back to `catalog.vue`, copy the `params` code... and paste it
here. Let's also copy the response line, paste that here too and return
`axios.get()`.

Finally, for the `params`, it's not `this.currentCategoryId` but `categoryIri`.
So `if (categoryIri)` then `params.category = categoryIri`.

[[[ code('7b9aca964a') ]]]

And... I need to fix my import code to use single quotes on `axios`.

Before we use this, let's add some docs: the `categoryIri` will be a `string` or
`null` and this will return a Promise.

[[[ code('192823b67c') ]]]

That's looking great!

## Use the Service in `catalog.vue`

Let's put it to use in `catalog.vue`. Like before, start by importing it:
`import {} from '@/services/products-service'` and then bring in the
`fetchProducts` function.

[[[ code('d1023c3bf8') ]]]

Now, down in `created()`, we don't need *any* of the `params` stuff anymore.
And the `response` line can now just be
`response = await fetchProducts(this.currentCategoryId)`.

[[[ code('c5463286d4') ]]]

This is *lovely*: the `created()` function reads like a story: set the
`loading` to true, call `fetchProducts()`, then set `loading` to false.

To finish the cleanup, remove the unused `axios` import.

Phew! We just made a lot of changes so... let's make sure we didn't break
anything. Do a full page refresh to be sure and... yea! Everything loads.
The products and sidebar work on every page and our code is better organized.

## Service: Return the Full Response? Data?

Before we keep going, I want to mention a design decision that I made. In a
service like `products-service`, we are returning the `Promise` from Axios.
That means that when we use `await` or chain a normal `.then()`, what we will
ultimately receive is the response... which we can then use to say things like
`response.data`.

But if you want, you *could* go a bit further in the service and add
`.then((response) => response.data)`.

By doing this, our function *still* returns a Promise. But instead of the
payload of the promise being the full AJAX response, it will be the JSON data.
To make the code work in `catalog`, we would set the function directly to the
`data` variable.

That makes the function a *bit* nicer to use. But... I'm going to completely undo
all of that. Why? Changing the function to directly give you the JSON data
is nice. The *problem* is if you ever needed to read something from the response,
like a header. If we only returned the data, reading a header wouldn't be possible.

That's why I typically keep my functions simple and return the Promise that
resolves to the entire Response. I need to do more work in my component, but
I also have more power.

Refresh one more time to make sure nothing broke! All good.

Next, hmm... I don't mind *some* of the loading on this page, but the categories
in the sidebar are starting to get on my nerves! It makes the
page look incomplete while it loads because the categories *feel* like part of
the *initial* page structure. We can fix that by passing the categories from the
server *directly* into Vue!
