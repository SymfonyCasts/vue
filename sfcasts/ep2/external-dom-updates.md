# External DOM Updates

When we add something to the cart, the last piece of data that's hardcoded is
the color. Now, *some* products come in multiple colors and others don't. But when
we *are* on a product with multiple colors - like our inflatable sofa - we need
to make sure that we send the selected color's IRI with the AJAX call.

Doing this is... pretty similar to how we handled the quantity. In that case,
we had an `input`. When the input changes, we update this `quantity` data via
`v-model`:

[[[ code('59471794a4') ]]]

Then, down here, it was very easy to reference `this.quantity` when
adding the item to the cart:

[[[ code('061c951fa9') ]]]

## Listening to the color-selected Event

For the color, we already have this cool color selector component. It lives in
`assets/components/color-selector.vue`. The important thing to know for *us*
is that whenever we select a color, this component emits a `color-selected` event
*and* sends the IRI of that color as the event data.

[[[ code('f943bad6ea') ]]]

So... we can use that! In `product-show.vue`, scroll up to the template and find
the color selector. There it is. We've already made this *only* render if the
product *does* come in multiple colors. If a product doesn't have multiple colors,
the `colors` array is empty. To listen to the event, add `@color-selected`
set to a new method: how about `updateSelectedColor`.

[[[ code('fb3c8eb320') ]]]

Next, copy the method name and scroll down to add a new piece of data:
`selectedColorId` set to null:

[[[ code('0a4c740807') ]]]

Under `methods` paste `updateSelectedColor()`. And because the event 
we're listening to sends the `iri` as its data, this will  receive an `iri` argument:

[[[ code('82b0e8583b') ]]]

Inside... `this.selectedColorId = iri`!

[[[ code('c5818347c9') ]]]

By the way, later in the tutorial, we'll learn how we *could* have written the
`color-selector` component in a way that would allow us to use `v-model`
on it, instead of listening to an event and creating this method. Yep, `v-model`
isn't just for *real* form inputs: it can also be used for custom components.

Anyways, up in `addToCart()`, change to use `color: this.selectedColorId`. Because
this defaults to `null`, if a product doesn't come in multiple colors, this will
still be null, and everyone will be happy.

[[[ code('43c16ea9ac') ]]]

## Very Basic Color Validation

Oh, except we need to make sure that if the product *does* have a color, that the
user *selects* a color before adding the item. We can do that right here: if
`this.product.colors.length` - so if this product comes in multiple colors -
*and* `this.selectedColorId === null`, we have a problem! 

[[[ code('e8cf8349d0') ]]]

For now, I'm just going to `alert('Please select a color first')`... and return.

[[[ code('d98c1d06b9') ]]]

That's not a great user experience, but it's good enough for us. Solving this
correctly wouldn't be much more work: I'd create a new piece of data - like
`addToCartError` - set that here, and render it above.

Ok: let's try this thing. Move over and... I'll refresh just to be safe. Click
"Add to Cart". Alert!

Ok, we have 15 items in the cart now. Select green, quantity 1, "Add to Cart"
and... it looks like it worked! Let's refresh. Yep! The cart is up to 16. In the
Vue dev tools, find the `cart`. Two items. And... this has `quantity` 1 *with* a
color set.

## Updating the Shopping Cart Header Count

At this point. I'm pretty happy with our "add to cart" feature. Well, happy except
for one detail: I don't like that the shopping cart count in the header doesn't
update until I refresh the page.

But... what can we do? That isn't inside of our Vue app!

The answer is... who cares? What I mean is, if it's important for us to update this
count for a good user experience, we can *totally* do it using good, boring
JavaScript.

Open the template that holds this: `templates/base.html.twig`. I'll search
for "shopping cart". Here it is: line 44. To make it easy to *find* this `span`
in JavaScript, add an `id="js-shopping-cart-items"`.

[[[ code('be97996f3e') ]]]

Next, back in the component, after we successfully add the item to the cart, we
can say  `document.getElementById()` - paste `js-shopping-cart-items` -
then `.innerHTML = getCartTotalItems()`.

[[[ code('ecff21696f') ]]]

That's a *new* function that we haven't used yet. When I hit tab to auto-complete
it, PhpStorm added the new import for us... though I'm going to move this all back
onto one line.

Anyways, the function comes from `cart-service` - the file we copied into our project
a few minutes ago. Here it is. Very simply, it loops through the items and counts
all of them using their quantity. A simple helper to get the number.

[[[ code('5c2a363763') ]]]

Back in `product-show.vue`, down in the method, we can call `getCartTotalItems()`
and pass it `this.cart`. Because this returns a Number, call `.toString()` on the
result.

[[[ code('996de09ce0') ]]]

So... no. This is *not* the most hipster code that you will ever write. But it
*will* work and give us the great user experience we want. If I needed to update
this header from *multiple* places in my code, I would *definitely* isolate it
into its own JavaScript module to avoid duplication.

Let's see if it works! Back at the browser, make sure to refresh so the `span`
gets the new id. Let's add 3 more green sofas. Watch the header... boom! That is
*so* nice.

Next: with the add to cart done, let's create a new page: one that will display
the shopping cart and checkout!
