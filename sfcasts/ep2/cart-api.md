# Cart API & Data

Ok team! We have two great pages - a product catalog and a product show page.
We're ready to start adding products to our cart.

To help with this, in the `tutorial/` directory - which you should have if you
download the course code - copy the `cart-service.js` file into
`assets/services/`.

## The Cart API Endpoints & Service

Just like product, category and color, "cart" is one of the "resources" in our
API. Check it out: go to `http://localhost:8000/api`. Yep, we have a set of
endpoints to *create*, view or modify a cart. And each cart has an "id".

Now, on the server, we're storing the current user's cart ID in the session. And
if the user *does* currently have a cart, we're dumping its ID onto the page as a
global variable. Check it out: right click in the browser, go to "View Page Source"
and search for "cart". There we go: `window.cartIri = null` because - right now -
we do *not* have a cart associated with our session yet.

The `cart-service.js` file holds a number of functions for fetching the cart, adding
items to the cart and so on. To get the cart id, this calls `getCartIrI()`, which
reads that global variable:

[[[ code('07d365de22') ]]]

Back in `addItemToCart()`:

[[[ code('a8bcc361be') ]]]

this is smart  enough to work even if the user doesn't have a cart yet. 
If the `cartIri` is *not* null, it updates it. But if it *is* null, it creates 
a new cart, which our API will automatically associate with the current user's session.

By the way, the cart data itself is *also* stored in the session instead of the
database. That fact is completely *not* important for us in Vue. I just mention
it in case you're an API Platform geek and want to see how that was implemented.
In a real app, I *would* store carts in the database.

So from a JavaScript perspective, the important thing is that we have a traditional
set of API endpoints for our cart and the current user's cart IRI is available
to us on page load.

Now, here's the plan: in `product-show`, we're going to *first* load the full cart
data via an Ajax call if there is one. Once we have that, we'll *use* it to add
new items to the cart. Wait... but why do we need to fetch the cart data in order
to add an item to it?

The reason is... well... in *part* because I'm trying to make our life difficult.
But that's not the entire reason. Look at `addItemToCart`: 

[[[ code('0e681eba69') ]]]

the `cart` object is  the first argument. That's needed so that if we add a product 
to the cart and it's  already *in* the cart, it can read the existing quantity 
and *increase* it. Now, we *could* have moved this smartness into our API, 
which would make our life easier here. But since we don't always have that luxury 
in the real world, we'll handle it in JavaScript.

Oh, and speaking of complications, we could *also* make our life simpler by
rendering the *entire* cart object as the global variable... instead of just the
IRI. In `templates/base.html.twig`, at the bottom, this where we're setting
the `cartIri` variable. If we output the *entire* cart as JSON, then we could
avoid an AJAX call in Vue. I probably *would* do that in a real app. But for the
tutorial, this AJAX call is going to complicate things in *wonderful* ways.

## Fetching the Cart via AJAX

Anyways, let's get to work! Inside `product-show.vue`, we need the `cart` object
so that we can use it when an item is *added* to the cart. Down in `data`, add
a new key to store this: `cart`.

[[[ code('1b3ac74345') ]]]

Next, in `created()`, call one of the new functions - `fetchCart()` and let
PhpStorm auto-complete that: we want the one from `assets/`. But, hmm: let's make
sure PhpStorm stops looking at the `tutorial/` directory: right click on it and go
to "Mark Directory as Excluded".

Anyways, when I auto-completed that, PhpStorm added the `fetchCart` import for us.
Back in create, since `fetchCart()` returns a `Promise`, we can say `.then()`
and pass a callback with a `cart` argument. Inside, all we need is
`this.cart = cart`.

[[[ code('da63dd9950') ]]]

If you're wondering why I didn't use `await`, good... wondering! If we *had* used
`await`, it would mean that this first AJAX call would need to finish before the
second one could even start. By using `.then()`, both AJAX calls will effectively
start instantly.

Ok! Let's make sure the data loads! Refresh the page, go over to the Vue Dev
tools, Components... and find `ProductShow`. Yes! We have a `cart` data set to
an object with an `items` key. It's empty because, in reality, we *don't* have
a cart yet. But the `fetchCart()` function is nice enough to create an empty object
for us in this case.

Next, let's hook up the "Add to Cart" button *and* make sure the user *cannot*
add any items until we're ready.
