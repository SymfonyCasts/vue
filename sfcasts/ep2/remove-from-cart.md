# Remove From Cart

Our cart page is *nearly* fully functional! Just one last task: bring the remove
button to life!

Let's repeat the process we used for quantity. Start in `cart-item`. Find the
button so we can add an "on click". I'll break this onto multiple lines.
`@click=` then `$emit` and call the event, how about, `removeFromCart`, though
`remove-from-cart` would better follow the standard naming convention for events.

[[[ code('30daa091e1') ]]]

Unlike quantity, this time, we do *not* need to include *any* data with the event:
we're simply saying "remove from cart".

Next, in `index.vue`, listen to this with `@removeFromCart=""`. Do the same thing
we did before: emit an event with the same name - `removeFromCart` - and make
sure to include `productId` and `colorId` so that our parent component knows *which*
item to remove. I'll copy these from the emit above.

*Finally*, we can listen to the `removeFromCart` event from the top level
`shopping-cart.vue`. Scroll up. Hey! I have an extra import I can remove - yay!
Keep going to find the `<shopping-cart-list` component. Add `@removeFromCart=""`.

But this time, instead of calling a method on *this* component, let's *immediately*
put a new method in the mixin to handle *everything* related to removing an item
from the cart.

## Adding More Mixin Logic

Over in `get-shopping-cart.js`, add a new method called `removeProductFromCart()`.
We know this will need the `productId` and `colorId` to identify *which* item it
is. Inside, we can call another function from `cart-service` that we haven't used
yet. It's called `removeItemFromCart()`. Hit tab so that it adds the import
for us. Pass this the cart: `this.cart`, `productId` and `colorId`.

[[[ code('7d2d6f7fc9') ]]]

Hold Command or Ctrl and click `removeItemFromCart` to jump into that function.
Just like with `updateCartItemQuantity()`, this does two things: it *modifies*
the cart object to remove the item and *then* makes an AJAX call to save that to
the server.

[[[ code('f6f9f91d6e') ]]]

Back in the mixin, don't forget to update the header: `this.updateCartHeaderTotal()`.
Oh, but let's `await` for the AJAX call to finish before doing this.

[[[ code('34eba40bef') ]]]

Ok: let's put our new method to work! Back in `shopping-cart.vue`, since we use that
mixin, we can call the method directly: `removeProductFromCart()` passing
`$event.productId` and `$event.colorId`.

Testing time! Find your browser and do a full page refresh to be safe. Right now,
we have 15 items. Remove the couch with quantity 3 and.... it worked! The header
says 12, the item is gone, the total updated. We rock! *And*, when we refresh,
the item *is* still gone.

Next: I have a challenge for us! To help sell, I mean, "share", more high quality
merchandise with the world, the marketing department has asked us to add a
"featured product" to the sidebar of the cart page *with* the ability to add
that item to the cart *directly* from this page - including choosing the color.

To accomplish this, we're going need to reuse a *lot* of code between the sidebar
and the cart show page. Let's do it!
